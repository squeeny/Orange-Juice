# Orange-Juice
Simple Currency Cheat for 100% Orange Juice [Steam]

Static Offsets for 1.17.3:

Stars = 0x27D4C8
Fruits = Stars+0xAB8
Halloween Candy = Stars+0x8E8
Christmas Candy = Stars+0x8EC

I do not wish to publicly distribute my cheat base .dll's, so here is a public c# source, written only for this game and using static offsets because I cannot be bothered implementing AOB scans for such a simple program.

100% Orange Juice is a VAC enabled game. I'm fairly sure VAC only checks process signatures when you are online in a match, so only use this program when you have the shop open. If you're scared of getting VAC banned, use cheat engine instead. To use static offsets in cheat engine, go to Add Address Manually and enter 100orange.exe+(hex offset). If you're too scared to use cheat engine, I suggest you go earn your money legitimately. 

Use entirely at own risk. I am not responsible for anything which can happen in regards to usage of my sources and/or releases.
