# Orange-Juice 1.28.5
Simple Currency Cheat for 100% Orange Juice [Steam]. All it does is set each currency type to their maximum values so you can buy whatever you want from the store. Version 1.26 added a Valentines Event where you have to collect chocolates, this has been removed from 1.27. Some version (I'm not sure since I didn't keep up to date) removed christmas candies.

With the steam inventory upgrade, more currencies are being moved to the steam inventory, which cannot be modified by this program, and thus you will not be able to buy all the cosmetics. I believe that fruitbat factory will eventually move all currencies (apart from stars) to the inventory, which makes this program not as useful for lazy players such as myself.

Disclaimer:

100% Orange Juice is a VAC enabled game. I'm fairly sure VAC only checks process signatures when you are online in a match, so only use this program when you have the shop open. If you're scared of getting VAC banned, use cheat engine instead. To use static offsets in cheat engine, go to Add Address Manually and enter 100orange.exe+(hex offset). If you're too scared to use cheat engine, I suggest you go earn your money legitimately.  Use entirely at own risk. I am not responsible for anything which can happen in regards to usage of my sources and/or releases.
